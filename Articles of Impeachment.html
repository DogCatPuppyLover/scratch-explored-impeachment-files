<p>On July 4th, 2021, Canuck (@scratch-explored), using the account @MexicanDream-, in reply to Bunny (@CraftyPanda146), made ableist comments that mocked autistic people for having "cringey" interests and called non-autistic people "normal". Following are those comments:</p>

<blockquote>And sometimes stuff is just not something human beings DO, its not normal, so its cringe, its looked down on. You cant say oh I have an feet interest but im autistic so you cant say its weird! Like no. Its weird. Stop. Its cringe.</blockquote>

<blockquote>NOOOO NO NO NO YOU ARE WRONGGGGGG NOTHING IS SOMETHING AUTISTIC PEOPLE DOOOOOOOOOO ITS NOT JUST "ONLY AUTISTIC PEOPLE DO THIS" OR THAT NOOOOOOOOOO NORMAL PEOPLE, CAN DO CRINGEY THINGS, THAT NOT A SINGLE AUTISTIC HUMAN COULD HAVE DONE IN THE WORLD AND ITS STILL MAKING FUN OF AUTISIC PEOPLE?????</blockquote>

<p>On July 6th, 2021, in response to this, Isla (@DogCatPuppyLover on Scratch), with the approval of 4 other managers, delivered the following message to Canuck outside of Scratch.</p>

<blockquote><p>This is your final warning, delivered on behalf of the managers of the LGBTQ+ studio. Stop bullying @CraftyPanda146, being ableist, and otherwise behaving inappropriately for a manager, and apologize directly to @CraftyPanda146 for the aforementioned (use one of your Scratch accounts, such as @OfcIStillLoveYou, to send your apology to @CraftyPanda146). You have 24 hours to apologize to them. If you do not apologize in time or breach this final warning, there will be an impeachment trial.</p>

<p>Approved by 4 other managers</p></blockquote>

<p>Canuck (@Coolghastforlife) subsequently apologized to Bunny (@CraftyPanda146). However, the comment has since been deleted.</p>

<blockquote>Yo sup Mexican dream here. I'm sorry for being mean and rude a few nights ago, it was uncalled for, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that, it's my bad, sorry.</blockquote>

<p>On July 16th, 2021, Canuck (@Coolghastforlife), yet again made ableist comments, saying in regards to trigger warnings for food, that "its just food" and that "ir doesnt need a trigger warning".</p>

<blockquote>Ok ok ok, ill ask a question. How is somethinf that everyone does and eats a trigger? Why is it a trigger, it might be a discomfort but imo, ir doesnt need a trigger warning because at the end od the day, its just food"</blockquote>

<p>Later on that same day, Canuck (@Coolghastforlife) mocked a TW that a friend of Bunny's (@Crafty_Froggy_Boy146) put and invalidated multiple triggers. They showed no remorse for their actions and mocked people for "being sensitive".</p>

<p>To quote from Bunny (@Crafty_Froggy_Boy146) about the situation:

<blockquote>So I obviously the ableism got to me. But also they made fun of obscure triggers and called people who had them "sensitive".<br><br>And it made me think "wow am I actually welcome here???" And it didn't really help that I'm not doing well on my own"</blockquote>

<p>Here is a transcript of the section of the conversation that was documented in screenshots:</p>

<blockquote><p>Bunny (@Crafty_Froggy_Boy146): "Being wrong :3"</p>

<p>Canuck (@Coolghastforlife): "About what? That some triggers shouldnt be triggers?"</p>

<p>Canuck (@Coolghastforlife): "Sorry,.but i think im right lol"</p>

<p>Bunny (@Crafty_Froggy_Boy146): "TW Breakdowns)) Nah bro. Anything can be a trigger. Just respect them and move on???? Like it's literally not that hard to put a warning...Or do you want them to have a mental breakdown becasue you thought the trigger was invalid? Hm."</p>

<p>Canuck (@Coolghastforlife): "TW)) letter L) So ANYTHING can be a trigger? Like the letter L? Theres a point where triggers just arent triggers and its impossible to believe it"</p>

<p>Bunny (@Crafty_Froggy_Boy146): "TW Breakdowns)) Why are you so mad lmao? Just respect triggers it's literally not that hard to want someone to have a mental breakdown xoxo"</p>

<p>Canuck (@Coolghastforlife): "Why are ppl so sensitive xoxoxox :3"</p>

<p>Bunny (@Crafty_Froggy_Boy146): "Bestie you're just being ableist now"</p></blockquote>

<p>Around October 12, 2021, Canuck (@scratch-explored), again on Canuck (@Coolghastforlife), replied to Bunny (@Crafty_Froggy_Boy146), dismissing his concerns (the screenshot given was of the messages page, so we don't have context):</p>

<blockquote><p>Im not being rude im being realistic</p>

<p>again wth am i meant to do i live miles away</p>

<p>"We good now"</p></blockquote>

<p>On October 16, 2021, Canuck (@Coolghastforlife) again replied to another comment by Bunny (@Crafty_Froggy_Boy146), who had asked them not to interact. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/5842709/comments/#comments-163847814">https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/5842709/comments/#comments-163847814</a></p>

<p>On October 21, 2021, Bunny (@Crafty_Froggy_Boy146) announced on his profile that he was leaving, presumably because of the harassment. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Crafty_Froggy_Boy146/#comments-166879738">https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Crafty_Froggy_Boy146/#comments-166879738</a></p>

<p>In all this, Canuck (@scratch-explored) has repeatedly made ableist comments and behaved with disrespect towards curators, even after being warned.</p>

<p>Wherefore, Canuck (@scratch-explored) has demonstrated that they are unfit for the position of manager. Canuck (@scratch-explored) thus warrants removal from the position of manager.</p>
